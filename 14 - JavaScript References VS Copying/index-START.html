    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2) // 200, 100

    let name = 'Bry';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Bry Bry
    name2 = 'Bryan'
    console.log(name, name2) // Bry Bryan

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    team[3] = 'Bryan'
    // players will now be ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Bryan'];

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team[2] = 'Klev';
    // but players will not change bc we made a copy

    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players] // spread

    // OR
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      // number: 1,
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // start with a blank object, object wants to copy, a property to add or overwrite
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99});
    console.log(cap2)

    // Or object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    const wes = {
      name: 'Bryan',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        love: 'sex',
        hate: 'porn',
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    const hoang = {...wes};
    console.log(hoang) // shallow copy

    // deep clone: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)): basically this will not change the original
    // object if I decide to change a property on a second object. We want to copy the object completely
    const hoang2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    //^ what the above does is hacky: it makes the object into a string and then remake
    // that string into a JSON again
    //Might have performance issues

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
